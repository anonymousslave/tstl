/**
 * <p> A common interface for tree-structured set. </p>
 *
 * <p> {@link ITreeSet TreeMultiSets} are containers that store elements following a specific order. </p>
 *
 * <p> In a {@link ITreeSet}, the value of an element also identifies it (the value is itself 
 * the <i>key</i>, of type <i>T</i>). The value of the elements in a {@link ITreeSet} cannot 
 * be modified once in the container (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed 
 * from the  </p>
 *
 * <p> Internally, the elements in a {@link ITreeSet TreeMultiSets} are always sorted following a strict 
 * weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison method (of {@link IComparable.less less}). </p>
 *
 * <p> {@link ITreeSet} containers are generally slower than {@link IHashSet} containers 
 * to access individual elements by their <i>key</i>, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on 
 * their order. </p>
 *
 * <p> {@link ITreeSet TreeMultiSets} are typically implemented as binary search trees. </p>
