/**
 * <p> Common interface for hash map. </p>
 * 
 * <p> {@link IHashMap}s are associative containers that store elements formed by the combination of 
 * a <i>key value</i> and a <i>mapped value</i>. </p>
 *
 * <p> In an {@link IHashMap}, the <i>key value</i> is generally used to uniquely identify the 
 * element, while the <i>mapped value</i> is an object with the content associated to this <i>key</i>. 
 * Types of <i>key</i> and <i>mapped value</i> may differ. </p>
 *
 * <p> Internally, the elements in the {@link IHashMap} are not sorted in any particular order with 
 * respect to either their <i>key</i> or <i>mapped values</i>, but organized into <i>buckets</i> depending on 
 * their hash values to allow for fast access to individual elements directly by their <i>key values</i> 
 * (with a constant average time complexity on average). </p>
 *
 * <p> Elements with equivalent <i>keys</i> are grouped together in the same bucket and in such a way that 
 * an iterator can iterate through all of them. Iterators in the container are doubly linked iterators. </p>

 * <dl>
 *	<dt> Associative </dt>
 *	<dd> Elements in associative containers are referenced by their <i>key</i> and not by their absolute 
 *		 position in the container. </dd>
 * 
 *	<dt> Hashed </dt>
 *	<dd> Hashed containers organize their elements using hash tables that allow for fast access to elements 
 *		 by their <i>key</i>. </dd>
 * 
 *	<dt> Map </dt>
 *	<dd> Each element associates a <i>key</i> to a <i>mapped value</i>: 
 *		 <i>Keys</i> are meant to identify the elements whose main content is the <i>mapped value</i>. </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * @param <Key> Type of the key values. 
 *				Each element in an {@link IHashMap} is identified by a key value.
 * @param <T> Type of the mapped value. 
 *			  Each element in an {@link IHashMap} is used to store some data as its mapped value.
